# Using the NanoVNA

## Calibration

The official manual of the NanoVNA has a section on [how to calibrate the NanoVNA](https://nanovna.com/?page_id=2).

### Tips

- Select the right mode/frequency synthesizer chip
  - If you updated the firmware, several config settings might have been changed, which is noticeable in excessive spurs/unsteadiness of the graphs. Be sure to check the menu `CONFIG>EXPERT SETTINGS>MORE>MODE` and select the right model. Newer NanoVNAs tend to use MS5351, but after a firmware update mode is reset to the default, Si5351, which will show as excessive spurs in the output.



## Measuring

If you have the RF Demo Kit mentioned in [NecessaryToolsAndParts](NecessaryToolsAndParts.md), you can test your NanoVNA and see if it creates valid results.
