# Necessary tools and parts

The RF prototype boards have a 0.1" pin pitch, which means the pad holes are 100 mils (= 2.54 mm) apart from each other. Also, the pads on the boards are separated by 10 mils (= 0.254 mm), so any SMD component that comfortably bridges this gap can be used.

You will need 0805 (2.0 mm × 1.25 mm) or 0603 (1.6 mm × 0.8 mm) or 0402 (1.0 mm × 0.5 mm) sized SMD components. SMD sizes are given in [imperial code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrated_circuit_packaging_types#Rectangular_passive_components), not metric code.

Since SMD part should make solid connections, the smallest size would be 0402 (1.0 mm × 0.5 mm). Smaller sizes will have their SMD pads reaching into the gap between two board pads, instead of being fully touching the boards pads.

Choose the part size depending on how much of the board pads (and their holes) you want to cover, and ease of solderability.

## Recommended lead-free solder

After trying various lead-free solders, I can recommend Sn100Ni+ as a well flowing solder making nice shiny joints.<br/>
A 0.5 mm diameter is well suited for SMD components, while still allowing to solder through-hole parts.

The exact solder I use is called `Felder ISO-Core "Ultra-Clear" Sn100Ni+ 0.5mm`.
